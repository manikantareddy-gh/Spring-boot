First — What is RAG? RAG ante — Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Simple ga cheppali ante — Gen AI model ki manam icchina documents (like PDFs, Word files) nundi sensitive or specific answers ravadaniki help chesthundi. Normal AI ki general knowledge untundi, kani nee personal data or custom documents gurinchi telidu. RAG system vallaa — AI ni mana documents tho kalipi, mana data base chesina questions ki answer cheyyagaladu. --- Step 1: Data Ingestion & Preparation (Left Side) Idea: Mana documents ni system lo ready cheyyadam. 1. PDF / Word files: Ivi mana input documents. Eg: Project report, policy file, or syllabus PDF. 2. PDF/Word Loader: Ee step lo, documents nundi text extract chestam. Tools like PyPDFLoader or DocxLoader use chestaru (LangChain lo available untayi). 3. Chunking: AI model ki oka limit untundi — chinna chinna text pieces matrame process cheyyagaladu (called context window). So, big documents ni chinna chinna parts (chunks) ga cut chestam. 4. Chunk Overlap: Oka chunk end lo unna konni lines next chunk start lo kuda include chestam — so context miss kakunda untundi. (Like story lo previous line gurthundali kadha — ade logic) 5. Embedding: I chunks ni vector format (numbers) lo convert chestam. Ee numbers meaning ni represent chestayi — similar meaning unna chunks, vector space lo daggara untayi. (Eg: “Apple fruit” & “Banana” vectors close untayi, kani “Laptop” far untundi) --- Step 2: Vector Database (Middle Part) Idea: Embeddings anni store cheyyadam. Ee database normal SQL kindha kadhu — Vector Database (like Pinecone, FAISS, Chroma). It’s made for fast searching of similar meanings. So later, when user adigina question meaning ki similar text ni easy ga find cheyyagaladu. --- Step 3: RAG Flow (Right Side) Idea: User question ki answer generate cheyyadam using the documents. 1. User Input: User question adigadu — “What is mentioned about AWS architecture in my document?” 2. RAG Process Starts: System question ni kuda vector lo convert chestundi. 3. Retrieval: Ee question vector ni database lo compare chestundi — similar meaning unna chunks ni find chestundi (top 3 or top 5 relevant pieces). 4. Prompt Template: Aa retrieved chunks ni user question tho kalipi oka prompt create chestam — example: > “Based on the following document parts, answer this question…” 5. LLM (Large Language Model): Ee prompt ni Gen AI model (like GPT or Llama) ki send chestam. Model context ni use chesi accurate answer generate chestundi. 6. User Output: Final answer back to user — exactly from his/her documents base lo. --- Summary in Simple Words Documents ni load chestam Text ni chinna chinna chunks ga break chestam Chunks ni numbers (embeddings) ga convert chestam Avi vector database lo store chestam User adigina question ni vector chestam Similar chunks ni retrieve chestam Chunks + question ni kalipi LLM ki pampistam LLM answer generate chestundi based on your document Eppudu nenkuda oka gen ai application chedham ani anukuntunna so na usecase vochesi edhi anamata Many employees struggle to choose the right insurance plan, especially when faced with multiple options like health, dental, life, and wellness benefits. I personally experienced this confusion while using platforms like Policy Bazaar, where selecting the right policy based on individual needs was overwhelming. In our portal, which serves U.S.-based clients, employees often have to choose from a wide range of insurance providers and plans. Unlike in India, where we typically select a predefined range based on company policy, U.S. employees must evaluate and compare different plans to find what suits them best. To address this challenge, I'm proposing a Generative Al-powered assistant that helps employees make informed decisions. The Al would: Understand the employee's profile and needs Suggest suitable insurance plans across providers Explain coverage in simple terms Highlight pros and cons based on usage patterns This would reduce confusion, improve benefits utilization, and enhance the overall user experience on the platform So Naku gen ai gurinchi asala em theliyadhu eppudu Ela project eppudu chiyalee so Naku Ela chiyali ani adigithe paina echina flow chepparu So Naku mundhu em em chiyali annadhi cheppava like em em install chesukovali like vs code lantivi paina cheppina I anii vadali like rag, vector database, api, Inka evo vunnai ga kunchum Naku indhullo helo chiyava dead line chala dhagara lo vundhi
